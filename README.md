# MySpotify
This app was created as a part of my studies. The purpose is to practice connecting to Spotify API, authenticate an user profile and fetch data.

I first tried this with the instructions found from Spotify-documentation and used Vite as a developement server. After repeated tries I was not able to get that solution to work, maybe because the app was running in localhost, I decided to try GitHub-pages.

With GitHub pages some of the problems persisted, but finally I was able to get the page up and running after changing to completely use JavaScript and changing some of the html-code.
